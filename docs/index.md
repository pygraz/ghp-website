# Python User Group Graz

We are a group of people meeting on a regular basis in [Graz](https://osm.org/go/0Iz~DnN--?relation=34719) (Styria/Austria) to talk about the programming language [python](https://www.python.org).

We are open for everyone and are looking forward to meeting you!

## :material-handshake: Spektral needs your help!

The local club "[Spektral](https://spektral.at)" has provided the
Python Usergroup Graz<br/> a consumption-free area for meetings for a very long time.

They helped us to develop and keep pygraz a free-to-access meeting for everybody.
It is a incubator and home for a variety of interesting groups in Graz.<br/>

Now they try to **buy its leased property** (which has been rented since 25 years).

**And you can help : Join the movement and help to buy the Spektral!**
