# Python User Group Graz

We are a group of people meeting on a regular basis in [Graz](https://osm.org/go/0Iz~DnN--?relation=34719) (Styria/Austria) to talk about the programming language [python](https://www.python.org).

We are open for everyone and are looking forward to meeting you!


## ATTENTION : UPDATE 

:material-account-alert: Due to sickness of our speaker todays talk is canceled!

The meeting will take place, but without a talk.

## Not today: "Modern ops in Python"


Bring up a Kubernetes cluster from the ground up, using Pulumi for Infra-as-(Python)Code, as well as good practices for hosting (Python) applications on it.

Participants (who want to follow along on their laptop) would need a working Docker setup, and either nix or the following tools:

- kind and cloud-provider-kind
- kubectl and (optionally) k9s
- the Cilium and Hubble CLIs
- Pulumi, with its Python language plugin
