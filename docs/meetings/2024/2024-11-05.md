## Description

With the help of graphene, Django can be used as backend for GraphQL, which addresses some of the short comings of REST APIs.

But how well does this combination actually work, and when is it worth using a flexible GraphQL API instead of a simple REST API?

In this talk, Thomas Aglassinger shares his experience with implementing a GraphQL backend for a Flutter frontend using Django and graphene. Some of the topics covered are:

- Dynamic query design - What's possible, what isn't?
- Authentication with JWT - Is is worth it? Is it really necessary?
- Excessive database queries and what to do about it (N+1 queries).
- Database IDs vs GraphQL IDs
- Database result vs results using data classes'
