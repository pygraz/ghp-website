## Description

Lightning Talks!

Make a short presentation about a python topic of your choice. (typically 5 to 10 minutes).

Did you find a helpful Python package? 
Did you see an interesting talk at a conference and want to summarize for others? 
Did you learn about a nifty tool that simplifies Python development? 
Got anything new you want to talk about ...

Of course you can also join without an own talk ;-)

We are thankful and happy to be back at the realraum this time!'
