## Description

Lightning Talks!

Did you find a helpful Python package? Did you see an interesting talk at a Python conference and want to summarize it for others? Did you learn about a nifty tool that simplifies Python development? Did you encounter Python at a place you never expected? Make a short presentation about it, typically 5 to 10 minutes.

Of course you can also attend without giving talk.

But this time, giving a talk would add the opportunity to present it again at the Grazer Linuxtage 2023. Visit the GLT23 lightning talk page <https://pretalx.linuxtage.at/glt23/talk/WLT9MZ/> for more information on how to acquire a slot on the 15th of April 2023 between 14:00 and 14:45.

And in case you feel like spreading your Python knowledge even further consider signing up for Barcamp Graz 2023 <https://barcamp-graz.org/> on 6th of May 2023, where you can apply it in the context of user experience (UX) and development.'
