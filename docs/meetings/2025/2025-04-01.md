## Description

Based on our engaging discussion during our last session of PyGRAZ lightning talks, we are going to take a closer look at when object-relation mappings (ORMs) can help, and when they can get in the way of expressing clear and concise database interactions.

First, Dorian Santner shows how Django models can map database tables to Python objects. From that, a few lines of code are enough to build a simple application using the Django admin that lets your create, read, update and delete (CRUD) data. This includes filtering and searching larger lists of data.

Next, Thomas explains how build database views using Django's raw SQL connections. Database views can combine data from multiple tables in a way that makes it easier to integrate them into business intelligence (BI) tools such as Grafana. While such queries can also be phrased using Django's ORM, they tend to be harder to create, understand and maintain than plain SQL.'
