## Behind the curtain of the new PyGraz website

Until recently, the PyGraz website at https://pygraz.org was still using Django 1.0. Attempts to upgrade to a more recent version deemed to be rather futile because Django 1 and 2 radically differ in many ways. Unlike upgrading from Django 2 to 3 to 4 to 5, which typically has only comparable minor hick-ups.

After some pondering, we realized a static site generator is actually enough to hold out meeting notes and announce the next meeting.

The new site is based on [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a static site generator implemented in Python. For the design, it uses the [MkDocs material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) with some minor adjustments of the coloring scheme.

The website is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). To find your way through the project, read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/pygraz/ghp-website/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). Changes to the `main` branch are automatically deployed using the GitHub CI workflow in [deploy.yaml](https://github.com/pygraz/ghp-website/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml).

The interactive maps use [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). To create such inline maps, tap the "Share" button, enable "Include marker", and select "HTML". In the text box below, copy and paste the resulting `<iframe>` into any Markdown or HTML document.

## Potentially helpful MkDocs plugins

:material-account-circle-outline: Christoph Reiter

- [mkdocs-print-site-plugin](https://github.com/timvink/mkdocs-print-site-plugin/): Adds a print page to your site that combines the entire site, allowing for easy export to PDF and standalone HTML. See [demo](https://timvink.github.io/mkdocs-print-site-plugin/print_page.html).
- [mkdocs-redirects](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs-redirects): Create page redirects (e.g., for moved/renamed pages).
- [lychee](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee): Check external links. Example for integration into a project: [linkcheck.sh](https://github.com/msys2/msys2.github.io/blob/main/linkcheck.sh) (scripts to check), [lychee.toml](https://github.com/msys2/msys2.github.io/blob/main/lychee.toml) (configuration for lychee)

## Regular expressions with named groups in Python and (not) PostgreSQL

:material-account-circle-outline: Thomas Aglassinger

### Python

To find your bearing with regular expressions or debug non-working ones, consider using sites like [regular expressions 101](https://regex101.com/).

Example regular expression to extract an issue number like `#123` from a text:

```python
>>> import re
>>> re.match(r"^(.*)(?P<task_code>#\d+)(.*)$", "#123 Do something")
<re.Match object; span=(0, 17), match='#123 Do something'>
```

Here, the `#\d+` means "a hash (`#`) followed by at least one decimal digit."

The `(?P<task_code>#\d+)` means that part of the text matching a hash followed by digits should be made available as the named group "task_code".

```python
>>> re.match(r"^(.*)(?P<task_code>#\d+)(.*)$", "#123 Do something").group("task_code")
'#123'
>>> re.match(r"^(.*)(?P<task_code>#\d+)(.*)$", "Do something #123").group("task_code")
'#123'
```

To make things more readable and skip the internal regex compiling step (for example, inside loops), compile a regex, store it in a variable with a meaningful name, and reuse the compiled variant:

```python
>>> task_code_regex = re.compile(r"^(.*)(?P<task_code>#\d+)(.*)$")
>>> task_code_regex.match("Do something #123").group("task_code")
'#123'
```

### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL [supports regular expression](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-matching.html#FUNCTIONS-POSIX-REGEXP) with special operators and functions. As of 2008, regular expressions are also supported by standard SQL, although the notation slightly differs.

With `text ~ pattern` you can check if `text` matches pattern. This is somewhat comparable with the `like` operator.

```postgresql
select '#123 Do something' ~ '(.*)(#\d+)(.*)';
-- Result: true
```

To extract the value from `text` matching `pattern` in the group at index `group_index` (with the index 1 referring to the fist group), use:

```postgresql
select (regexp_match(text, pattern))[group_index];
```

For example:

```postgresql
select (
    regexp_match(
        '#123 Do something',  -- text
        '(.*)(#\d+)(.*)'      -- pattern
    )
)[2];                         -- group_index
-- Result: '#123'
```

The `regexp_match` function can only be used within the `select` fields. If you try to use within the `where` clause, PostgreSQL refuses to do so. You should not do that because similar to `like`, regular expressions cannot be indexed and queries involving them perform slowly and drain the database.

## Named groups with PostgreSQL

As of version 17, PostgreSQL does not support named groups.

As a workaround, you can use Python to get the index of a named group. For example:

```python
>>> task_code_regex.groupindex
mappingproxy({'task_code': 2})
>>> task_code_regex.groupindex["task_code"]
2
```

After that, convert the group in the regex to unnamed groups. For example:

```python
>>> r"^(.*)(?P<task_code>#\d+)(.*)$".replace("(?P<task_code>", "(")
'^(.*)(#\\d+)(.*)$'
```

Finally, store this information in a PostgreSQL table.
