# Modern ops in Python with Kybernetes

Bring up a Kubernetes cluster from the ground up, using Pulumi for Infra-as-(Python)Code, as well as good practices for hosting (Python) applications on it.

Participants (who want to follow along on their laptop) would need a working Docker setup, and either nix or the following tools:

- kind and cloud-provider-kind
- kubectl and (optionally) k9s
- the Cilium and Hubble CLIs
- Pulumi, with its Python language plugin
