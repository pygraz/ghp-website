# Lightning talks

## Improving our description for lightning talks

:material-account-circle-outline: Thomas Aglassinger<br>

With our recent invitation to this event, was lacking some information that raised questions, in particular:

- Is the event in German or English?
- How can one propose talks?
- When does the event start?

Together, we improved the template for future meetups with lightning talks:

> [Lightning talks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talks){:target="\_blank"} are very short presentations lasting only a few minutes. They are a great opportunity to share your knowledge with others and learn about multiple topics at once.
>
> Did you find a helpful Python package? Did you encounter Python at a place you never expected? Did you see an interesting talk at a Python conference? Did you learn about a nifty tool that simplifies Python development? Did you automate a boring chore using Python?
>
> Make a short presentation about it, typically 5 to 10 minutes, though it's perfectly fine to be quicker. If needed, use slides, show a related website - or just talk.
>
> Of course, everyone is welcome to just watch and listen, even without giving a talk.
>
> There is no need to propose a talk beforehand. Just drop by and we arrange the agenda together.
>
> The event will be held in English unless everyone on site speaks German. For slides, English is recommended so the information can be accessed afterward by a large audience.

The PyCon Austria 2026 will take place on 2026-04-19 and 2026-04-20 in Eisenstadt.

Attendance is free of charge, though it is highly appreciated if you [register](https://2026.pycon.at/registration/) to help with planning.

You can actively support the event by helping out on site or while preparing for it. In particular, the organizers are always looking for volunteers to:

- host sessions
- help with the registration process
- help with the logistics

If you are interested in helping out, please [contact them](https://2026.pycon.at/contact-us/).

If you want to support the event financially or present your product, various [sponsor packages](https://2026.pycon.at/sponsor-information/) are available.

For Python-related user groups or open source projects there also is the option to have a stand at the venue free of charge where you can inform people about your project or service.

## Variational Autoencorders: the cognitive scientist’s favorite deep learning tool

Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are a type of generative model that can be used to learn latent representations of data.

For instance, VAEs have been used to model how humans learn and represent facial expressions of emotions. By training VAEs on datasets of facial images, researchers have shown that the latent space can capture meaningful variations in facial features corresponding to different emotional states.

This is part of an ongoing series of talks about variational autoencoders. You can find the dates of these talks on the [r3 calendar](https://wp.realraum.at/kalender/).

## ijson

:material-snake: [ijson on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ijson/)

The Python library includes a [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) module to parse and render data in JSON format. It works find for many use cases, but it is not optimized for large JSON files because it loads the entire file into memory.

I recently had a requirement to be able to process a 2 GB JSON file on a Raspberry Pi with 2 GB RAM, so the standard module was no option.

Enter [ijson](https://pypi.org/project/ijson/), which can iteratively parse selected portions of large JSON files by specifying the path in the objects tree. To iterate over lists, add `item` to the path.

Example, based on the documentation:

```python
import ijson

# Create an iterater for all items in a JSON file available from a website.
item_stream = urlopen('http://.../')
items = ijson.items(item_stream, 'earth.europe.item')

# Create a generator to iterate over all items of type 'city'.
cities = (item for item in items if item['type'] == 'city')

# Process each city.
for city in cities:
    do_something_with(city)
```

For even more control, an event based parser is available the works similarly to [xml.parser.expat](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyexpat.html#example) from the standard library.
