## Description

Lightning Talks!

Did you find a helpful Python package? Did you encounter Python at a place you never expected? Did you see an interesting talk at a Python conference? Did you learn about a nifty tool that simplifies Python development? Did you automate a boring chore using Python?

Make a short presentation about it, typically 5 to 10 minutes. If needed, use slides, or show a related web site - or just talk.

Of course, everyone is welcome to just watch and listen, even without giving a talk.'
