## Description

Hello Pythonistas,

We are having a August-Meeting : this time in the "Steierstubn" at the Lendplatz.

As Corona still makes it difficult to get conference rooms, we decided to meet in a restaurant again.
Second summer meet and eat for Styrian Python users :-)

Please register on Meetup and dont forget to take your 3G confirmations with you!
Hope to see you on Tuesday!'
