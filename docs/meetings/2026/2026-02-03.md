# Flet app coding dojo

:material-clock-time-seven-outline: Tuesday, February 3rd 2026, 19:00

It's time again to do some coding together.

This time we take a look at [flet](https://flet.dev/), a Python library to build multi-platform apps with modern user interfaces. Behind the scenes it is based on [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), but hides the comparably complex build process and code structure from you. Applications developed with flet can be wrapped in self-contained apps that run natively on a wide range of platforms such as Android, Linux, macOS, or Windows.

After a quick presentation of the basics, together we are going to implement a simple but responsive application that shows how to use some of the most common user interface elements and how to interact with them.

A single laptop is shared between all attendants, and we will switch the keyboard so everyone can get to code parts of it. If someone gets stuck, we help each other out. The goal is to learn something new and have fun while doing it.
