## Description

Lightning Talks!

Did you find a helpful Python package? Did you see an interesting talk at EuroPython and want to summarize for others? Did you learn about a nifty tool that simplifies Python development? Make a short presentation about it (typically 5 to 10 minutes).

Of course you can also join without an own talk.

Join us and get more details on https://www.pygraz.org .'
