## Description

The corona lockdown was too long - lets meet and talk about python again!

This session takes place in the Gösserbräu - outside - with enough space to stay separated.
As usual we come together for our summer session - get a drink or two, some food and talk with other python users. No offical talks scheduled this time!'
