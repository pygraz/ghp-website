## Description

It's time again for a coding dojo to improve our programming skills and share coding tricks!

We are going to take a look at the Pew Pew micro console that can be programmed in MicroPython. It features a display of 8x8 pixels (amounting to 0.000064 megapixel!) and most of the buttons you find on a modern console controller.

The goal is that we can move a little space ship across the screen. And if there's enough time left, we might even make it shoot laser beams!'
