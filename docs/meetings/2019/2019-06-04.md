## Description

In June, we are going to have two talks. As this talk will be presumably held in German, it might be difficult to follow for non-German speakers. Anyhow, everyone is welcome to drop by. We are going to meet on Tue, 2019/06/04 at realraum. If you can make it to the realraum entrance, you will see us immediately (first room).

(1) Julian Rath is going to talk about “Multithreading, Multiprocessing und AsyncIO” (presumably German)

(2) The second talk is called “Python & Scientific Computing” (presumably German) by Stefan Reiterer.'
