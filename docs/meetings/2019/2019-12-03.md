## Description

In December, we are going to offer lightning talks on topics related to python.

You solved a small problem with python software? You have found and tried an interesting package on pypi? You discovered new features of a recent python version? Lightning talks give you an opportunity to share your findings with others and get some feedback. A lightning talk is a 5-10 minute presentation (slides are encouraged, but not necessary). Each talk is followed by a small discussion and a feedback session. In the best case, each participant gives a lightning talk such that we cover many small topics.
