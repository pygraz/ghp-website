## Meeting templates

### Lightning talks

[Lightning talks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talks){:target="\_blank"} are very short presentations lasting only a few minutes. They are a great opportunity to share your knowledge with others and learn about multiple topics at once.

Did you find a helpful Python package? Did you encounter Python at a place you never expected? Did you see an interesting talk at a Python conference? Did you learn about a nifty tool that simplifies Python development? Did you automate a boring chore using Python?

Make a short presentation about it, typically 5 to 10 minutes, though it's perfectly fine to be quicker. If needed, use slides, show a related website - or just talk.

Of course, everyone is welcome to just watch and listen, even without giving a talk.

There is no need to propose a talk beforehand. Just drop by and we arrange the agenda together.

The event will be held in English unless everyone on-site speaks German. For slides, English is recommended so the information can be accessed afterward by a large audience.

### Coding dojo

It's time again to do some coding together.

This time we take a look at (name and single sentence overview of the topic).

We are going to implement (outline of the intended solution).

The event is organized as [coding dojo](https://codingdojo.org/practices/WhatIsCodingDojo/). A single laptop is shared between all attendants, and we will switch the keyboard so everyone can get to code parts of it. No specific knowledge is required beside basic python programming. If someone gets stuck, we help each other out. The goal is to learn something new and have fun while doing it.

The event will be held in English unless everyone on-site speaks German.

### Meet and eat

(Before we go into the summer break) | (To start the new year), we meet again for to enjoy good food in a relaxed atmosphere. There is the opportunity to exchange ideas about everything that has to do with Python.

English speakers are welcome.
